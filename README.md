# `dotnet neater`

**NB: This project is a work in progress, and is currently not much more than a prototype.**

## Summary
The aim of this project is to build a C# code formatting tool that can be run from the command line -
a sort of "Prettier for C#".

## Innovation Day
Plan for today:
- Review and refactor the "Print" code, documentating it as I go so I understand it and capture that
understanding in the documentation.
- Write some supporting tests for some of the core code, partly to act as living documentation.
- Create a "Vision Statement" or similar that sets out what dotnet-neater hopes to achieve.
- Wrap all of the above documentation up into the README or supporting docs
- Start implementing some stuff?

Overall aim:
> Make the repo presentable and ready to work on
